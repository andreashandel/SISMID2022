**This is the beginning of the SISMID 2022 website. If you see this message, the content has not been fully updated from last year.**


Last update/recompile: `r Sys.time()`

Welcome to the website for the course/module called [Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Within-Host Models](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sismid2021/modules/MD2110), which is part of the [2022 Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sismid). 

The course is taught by [Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/) and [Paul Thomas](https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html). You can reach us all on Slack (see the **Communication** page). 


<!-- # Important! -->

<!-- **We are making some last-minute updates to the DSAIRM package. To make sure you have the latest, install it from GitHub the day before the workshop starts.** -->
<!-- (You can install it any time prior, or install from CRAN, just make sure if you do that to re-install the day before the workshop by typing these commands into the `R` console): -->

<!-- ``` -->
<!-- install.packages('remotes') #if you don't have the remotes package installed yet -->
<!-- library('remotes') -->
<!-- install_github('ahgroup/DSAIRM') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Then load the package and open the menu with these commands: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- library('DSAIRM') -->
<!-- dsairmmenu() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- For more details, see [the _Software Setup_ module of the SMI site](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse). -->

# Website content

The __Syllabus__ provides a brief overview with a few logistic details.

The __Schedule__ lists the topics, with links to materials. Most of the materials are on a separate site called [Simulation Modeling in Immunology](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/) which we use as the main, permanent repository for teaching materials related to this course (and other workshops). 

The __Communication__ section provides information on how course communications are planned to happen.

The __Resources__ section contains a listing of the main sources and materials we'll be using in this course, as well as links to further resources.

The __Project__ section has information and instructions for a - completely optional - course project you can do if you want. 


# Getting started

Start by briefly going through all the sections on this website. The go through and do everything listed in the _Before course start_ section of the __Schedule__. 

# Notes

We are a _Module_ of SISMID. However, for our purposes, we refer to our module as a _course_ or _class_, and use _module_ for individual segments, which are further divided into _units_. We hope this is not too confusing. 

By default, all links open in the current tab. You'll likely want external ones to open in a separate tab or window. To do so, you can (with most browsers) hold the `Ctrl` button when clicking, or do a right-click and select `open in new tab/window`.
